Hello! Welcome to Krush and Pixel Studios, a team made possible by Discord bot developers, zakdev. (KrushTheDeveloper), and pixelr_dev (PixelR)! 
This website has been made to showcase and provide users with high-quality Discord Bots!
The Devs will tell you a bit about themselves!

KrushTheDeveloper: Hello there! My name is KrushTheDeveloper, but most people call me by Krush. I'm a ROBLOX game developer that makes ROBLOX games and also made a bot!
His name is Sharky! My friend PixelR helped me make this bot and some of the features possible! We plan on making more bots under our
team as Krush and Pixel Studios! (K&P Studios)

PixelR: PIXEL TYPE SOME STUFF HERE!
